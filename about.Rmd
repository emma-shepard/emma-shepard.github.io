I am currently a second year masters student in the [Biostatistics Department] (https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health] (https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). My focus is pharmaceutical statistics. I have worked as a teaching assistant for both Randomized Clinical Trials and Introduction to SAS courses.


I received my B.S. in International Health from [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/) in 2013. For my thesis, I designed and conducted a study to assess the causes of persistant "hotspots" of lymphatic filariasis in Tamil Nadu, India.
